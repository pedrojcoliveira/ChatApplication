# Messaging App
This project serves as a platform for conversational interactions aimed at improving my proficiency in Kotlin and Android Studio. Through building this conversational app, I aim to hone my skills in Android development while delving deeper into Kotlin's features and best practices.


## Firebase Integration
This app utilizes Firebase to store user data and facilitate real-time messaging between users. Firebase Authentication is employed for user authentication, ensuring secure access to the messaging platform. Additionally, Firebase Realtime Database or Firebase Cloud Firestore is used to store and synchronize chat messages between users in real-time.
